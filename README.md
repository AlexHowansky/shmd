# South High Marathon Dance Photo Orders

See [shmd.org](http://shmd.org) to learn what SHMD is all about.

One of the many groups of participating volunteers is the photo crew.
Numerous photographers take thousands of photos of every aspect of
the dance. These are funneled back to a central server, where they
are distributed to printing stations for purchase by attendees. All
proceeds go straight to the SHMD fund pool.

In 2016, with little notice, the photo crew was informed that their
usual set up would no longer be possible to support. Due to lack of
sufficient power supply for all the printing and networking hardware,
the ordering and printing stations would have to be split into two
separate locations. This implied the need the create some mechanism
to relay print orders from the former to the latter. This application
was hastily thrown together in a weekend in an attempt to address that
requirement.
